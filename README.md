# ML-land-footprint
Machine learning algorithms for the prediction of land ecological footprint

Project written for the CSI5155 Machine Learning course.

Climate change is a growing problem in the world. A contributor to this problem is the ecological footprint a country may have, which is connected to how much impact a country has on the increase in carbon. How land is used increases or decreases the carbon emissions. Being able to predict the impact of land use on the environment can help countries to manage their land use in terms of curbing climate change. Machine learning can be used to make these predictions so that countries can make pre-emptive decisions, helping the environment and saving money. Finding the best algorithm for the national ecological footprint dataset will lead to better predictions.

Dataset: National ecological footprint of 196 countries. The data set has a size of 87,000 rows and 15 features. https://www.kaggle.com/footprintnetwork/national-footprint-accounts-2018
